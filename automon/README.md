Automon combines the power of AOP (AspectJ) with any monitoring or logging tools you already use to
declaratively monitor your Java code, the JDK, and dependent libraries. This module generates the core automon
aspect library for monitoring and tracing (org.automon.aspects) that you will need to include in your project.
