<!--
The 'user_monitor' pointcut defines what code you would like to time.  The 'user_exceptions' pointcut defines what code
you would like to monitor for exceptions.  Because often these should be the same you can define another pointcut that
they both point to. In the example below that is done with the 'profile' pointcut.

Pointcuts can be combined with boolean logic like AND, ||, !.  See the AspectJ documentation for more information
on the rich pointcut language.

Note you can specify any openmon by putting this argument in the first column in this comment section: org.automon=sysout

See ajc-aop.xml for more information and examples.
